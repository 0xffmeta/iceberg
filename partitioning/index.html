<h2 id="what-is-partitioning">What is partitioning?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-partitioning" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Partitioning is a way to make queries faster by grouping similar rows together when writing.</p>
<p>For example, queries for log entries from a <code>logs</code> table would usually include a time range, like this query for logs between 10 and 12 AM:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT level, message FROM logs
WHERE event_time BETWEEN '2018-12-01 10:00:00' AND '2018-12-01 12:00:00'
</code></pre>
<p>Configuring the <code>logs</code> table to partition by the date of <code>event_time</code> will group log events into files with the same event date. Iceberg keeps track of that date and will use it to skip files for other dates that don&rsquo;t have useful data.</p>
<p>Iceberg can partition timestamps by year, month, day, and hour granularity. It can also use a categorical column, like <code>level</code> in this logs example, to store rows together and speed up queries.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-iceberg-do-differently">What does Iceberg do differently?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-iceberg-do-differently" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Other tables formats like Hive support partitioning, but Iceberg supports <em>hidden partitioning</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Iceberg handles the tedious and error-prone task of producing partition values for rows in a table.</li>
<li>Iceberg avoids reading unnecessary partitions automatically. Consumers don&rsquo;t need to know how the table is partitioned and add extra filters to their queries.</li>
<li>Iceberg partition layouts can evolve as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="partitioning-in-hive">Partitioning in Hive<a class="headerlink" href="#partitioning-in-hive" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>To demonstrate the difference, consider how Hive would handle a <code>logs</code> table.</p>
<p>In Hive, partitions are explicit and appear as a column, so the <code>logs</code> table would have a column called <code>event_date</code>. When writing, an insert needs to supply the data for the <code>event_date</code> column:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">INSERT INTO logs PARTITION (event_date)
  SELECT level, message, event_time, format_time(event_time, 'YYYY-MM-dd')
  FROM unstructured_log_source
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, queries that search through the <code>logs</code> table must have an <code>event_date</code> filter in addition to an <code>event_time</code> filter.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT level, count(1) as count FROM logs
WHERE event_time BETWEEN '2018-12-01 10:00:00' AND '2018-12-01 12:00:00'
  AND event_date = '2018-12-01'
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>event_date</code> filter were missing, Hive would scan through every file in the table because it doesn&rsquo;t know that the <code>event_time</code> column is related to the <code>event_date</code> column.</p>
<h3 id="problems-with-hive-partitioning">Problems with Hive partitioning<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-with-hive-partitioning" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Hive must be given partition values. In the logs example, it doesn&rsquo;t know the relationship between <code>event_time</code> and <code>event_date</code>.</p>
<p>This leads to several problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hive can&rsquo;t validate partition values &ndash; it is up to the writer to produce the correct value<ul>
<li>Using the wrong format, <code>2018-12-01</code> instead of <code>20181201</code>, produces silently incorrect results, not query failures</li>
<li>Using the wrong source column, like <code>processing_time</code>, or time zone also causes incorrect results, not failures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is up to the user to write queries correctly<ul>
<li>Using the wrong format also leads to silently incorrect results</li>
<li>Users that don&rsquo;t understand a table&rsquo;s physical layout get needlessly slow queries &ndash; Hive can&rsquo;t translate filters automatically</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Working queries are tied to the table&rsquo;s partitioning scheme, so partitioning configuration cannot be changed without breaking queries</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="icebergs-hidden-partitioning">Iceberg&rsquo;s hidden partitioning<a class="headerlink" href="#icebergs-hidden-partitioning" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Iceberg produces partition values by taking a column value and optionally transforming it. Iceberg is responsible for converting <code>event_time</code> into <code>event_date</code>, and keeps track of the relationship.</p>
<p>Table partitioning is configured using these relationships. The <code>logs</code> table would be partitioned by <code>date(event_time)</code> and <code>level</code>.</p>
<p>Because Iceberg doesn&rsquo;t require user-maintained partition columns, it can hide partitioning. Partition values are produced correctly every time and always used to speed up queries, when possible. Producers and consumers wouldn&rsquo;t even see <code>event_date</code>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, queries no longer depend on a table&rsquo;s physical layout. With a separation between physical and logical, Iceberg tables can evolve partition schemes over time as data volume changes. Misconfigured tables can be fixed without an expensive migration.</p>
